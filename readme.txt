Documentation for the My Courses Portlet is hosted in Google Code.

If you're having trouble building this portlet from source, 
you're not alone, 
and that trouble probably has something to do with 
the necessary dependencies not yet being available. 


The reasons for this and plans for progress are documented 
on the my-courses-portlet site.
