A JSR-168 portlet that summarizes and links to the logged in user's participation in a backing course management system.

Currently the only implemented integration is into Sakai (a Collaboration and Learning Environment, and so the MyCoursesPortlet differentiates and displays links to both Course sites and Project non-course sites.)

One idea of direction to go would be to implement plugins for other course management systems, and even enhance the portlet to be capable of presenting links into multiple concurrent course management systems. This could assist with migration from one course management system to another or assist with supporting multiple in parallel.
